fix: Handle media synchronization on permission change

This commit fixes a bug where the app would crash if the storage permission was revoked while the media synchronizer was running.

- The `LocalMediaSynchronizer` is updated to properly stop and restart.
- The `MainActivity` now manages the synchronizer's lifecycle based on the permission status.
